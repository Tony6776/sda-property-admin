# Phase 2: Participant Self-Service Portal

**Status:** ‚úÖ COMPLETE - Live on Production
**Deployed:** https://tony6776.github.io/sda-property-admin
**Commit:** d5c7dd2
**Date:** October 2025

---

## üéØ Overview

Phase 2 delivers a complete **Participant Self-Service Portal** that empowers NDIS participants to:
- Create their own accounts and manage profiles
- View AI-matched SDA properties with match scores and reasons
- Upload required documents (NDIS plan, ID, income proof)
- Track their homeownership journey progress (0-100%)
- Express interest in properties and schedule viewings
- Manage location preferences and budget requirements

This is the **second layer** of the SDA market dominance strategy, providing participants direct access to property opportunities while automatically tracking engagement and lead quality.

## üì¶ What Was Built

### **6 New Participant Pages**

1. **Signup** (`/participant/signup`)
   - Email/password registration
   - Creates Supabase auth user + participant profile
   - Initial lead score calculation (20 points for signup)
   - Activity logging

2. **Login** (`/participant/login`)

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### **Authentication Flow**

```
User ‚Üí Signup ‚Üí Supabase Auth User Created
                 ‚Üì
        Participant Profile Created (participants table)
                 ‚Üì
        Initial Lead Score: 20
                 ‚Üì
        Activity Logged: signup_completed
                 ‚Üì
        Redirect to Dashboard
```

### **Journey Progress Calculation**

Progress is dynamically calculated 0-100% based on:

| Milestone | Points | Trigger |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| Profile created | 20% | Account signup |
| NDIS plan uploaded | 10% | Document upload |
| ID uploaded | 10% | Document upload |
| Income proof uploaded | 10% | Document upload |
| Locations set | 10% | Profile save with preferred_locations |
| Budget set | 10% | Profile save with max_weekly_budget |
| Matches found | 10% | AI matching finds 1+ properties |
| Excellent matches | 10% | AI matching finds 80+ score properties |
| Viewing scheduled | 10% | Status changes to 'viewing' |

### **Property Matching Display**

Properties are fetched with JOIN query:

```sql
SELECT
  property_matches.*,
  properties.*
FROM property_matches
JOIN properties ON property_matches.property_id = properties.id
WHERE property_matches.participant_id = :participant_id
  AND property_matches.match_score >= 60
ORDER BY property_matches.match_score DESC
```

**Match Reasons** are stored as JSON array:
```json
[
  { "reason": "Location Match", "details": "Preferred: Melbourne East" },
  { "reason": "Budget Match", "details": "$850/week fits your budget" },
  { "reason": "Accessibility", "details": "Fully accessible SDA" },
  { "reason": "SDA Category", "details": "Matches your NDIS plan" }
]
```

### **Document Storage**

Files are stored in Supabase Storage:
- Bucket: `participant-documents`
- Path: `{participant_id}/{doc_type}_{timestamp}.{ext}`
- RLS Policies: Users can only access their own documents
- Max file size: 10MB
- Allowed types: PDF, JPG, PNG

---

## üîê Security

### **Row Level Security (RLS)**

All participant data is protected with RLS policies:

```sql
-- Participants can only see their own data
CREATE POLICY "Participants can view own profile"
ON participants FOR SELECT
USING (user_id = auth.uid());

-- Participants can only see their own matches
CREATE POLICY "Participants can view own matches"
ON property_matches FOR SELECT
USING (
  participant_id IN (
    SELECT id FROM participants WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
  )
);
```

### **Protected Routes**

All participant pages except signup/login require authentication:
- Automatic redirect to login if not authenticated
- Participant profile verification on every protected route
- Session managed by Supabase Auth

---

## üìä Data Flow

### **Signup Flow**
```
1. User fills signup form
2. Create Supabase auth user (email/password)
3. Create participant profile with user_id link
4. Set initial lead_score = 20
5. Log 'signup_completed' activity
6. Send verification email
7. Redirect to login
```

### **Profile Update Flow**
```
1. User updates profile form
2. Save to participants table
3. Call calculate_participant_lead_score() RPC
4. Log 'profile_updated' activity
5. Trigger AI matching (if criteria changed)
6. Show success message
```

### **Document Upload Flow**
```
1. User selects file (drag/drop or click)
2. Upload to Supabase Storage (participant-documents bucket)
3. Update participants.{field}_uploaded = true
4. Log 'document_uploaded' activity
5. Call calculate_participant_lead_score() RPC
6. Update progress display (X/3 complete)
```

### **Property Match Interaction**
```
1. User clicks "Mark as Viewed"
2. Update property_matches.status = 'viewed'
3. Update property_matches.viewed_at = now()
4. Log 'match_viewed' activity
5. Button changes to "I'm Interested"

6. User clicks "I'm Interested"
7. Update property_matches.status = 'interested'
8. Log 'match_interested' activity
9. Show "Our team will contact you soon" message
```

## üìà Success Metrics

After Phase 2 completion, the system tracks:

**Participant Engagement:**
- Lead scores (0-100) auto-calculated
- Engagement levels (cold/warm/hot) based on activity
- Journey progress (0-100%) for each participant
- Document upload completion rate

**Property Matching:**
- Match scores for each participant-property pair
- Match reasons explanation for transparency
- Participant actions (viewed/interested/applied)
- Time-to-interest metrics

**Activity Tracking:**
- All user actions logged with timestamps
- Activity types: signup, login, profile_updated, document_uploaded, match_viewed, match_interested
- JSON activity data for detailed analytics

---

## üîÑ Integration with Phase 1

Phase 2 builds directly on Phase 1 foundation:

**Uses Phase 1 Database Schema:**
- `participants` table (profile data)
- `property_matches` table (AI matching results)
- `lead_activities` table (engagement tracking)
- `calculate_participant_lead_score()` RPC function

**Displays Phase 1 AI Matching:**
- Shows match scores calculated by Phase 1 algorithm
- Displays match reasons generated by AI matching
- Filters by quality thresholds (60+ minimum)

**Triggers Phase 1 Intelligence:**
- Profile updates trigger AI re-matching
- Document uploads update lead scoring
- Activity logging feeds engagement calculations
